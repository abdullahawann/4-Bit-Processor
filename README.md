# 4-Bit-Processor

This 4-bit processor project in Digital Logic Design (DLD) is a compact and efficient computing system that operates on 4-bit binary data. It consists of several key components, including a control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers, and a clock circuit.

The control unit oversees the overall operation of the processor, executing instructions and coordinating data movement between different parts. The ALU performs various arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, and OR, enabling mathematical computations and data manipulation.

Registers store and retrieve data temporarily within the processor. In my project, I have implemented a set of 4-bit registers to hold operands, intermediate results, and the final output of operations. These registers can also perform shifting and loading operations as required.

To synchronize the processor's activities, a clock circuit generates a regular series of clock pulses. These pulses serve as timing signals, controlling the sequencing of instructions and enabling the synchronized execution of various operations.

Overall, my 4-bit processor project in DLD demonstrates the fundamental principles of digital logic design and showcases the essential components necessary for a basic computing system. It offers a practical understanding of how binary data is processed and manipulated within a small-scale processor architecture.
